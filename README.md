# Sticky-Navigation with Style Change.

## About The Project

- This is an example code to see how you can use a fixed navigation, that allows you to view your links at anytime of the scroll.
- This is intented for anyone who wants to add a user-friendly experience to their projects.
- No framework or libraries required. You can achieve this with CSS alone, however Javascript comes in when you want to add a different styling at any point of the scroll.
- Please check the _Preview_ section to see how the style of the navbar changes when you start the scroll and how the navigation bar remains in it's position.
